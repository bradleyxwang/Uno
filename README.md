# Uno!

This is a full-stack TypeScript web application to host online Uno games with 2-8 players. This was a hackathon project that I completed with a group of my friends in college. This project builds on top of the preexisting [Covey.Town](https://github.com/neu-se/covey.town) open-source codebase. 

The frontend uses React.js components and React Native to display the Uno user interface to players. The backend uses a RESTful API with Express.js and a MongoDB database to store player match history and elo ratings.
